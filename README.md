Bass Racer
Goal is to travel the longest possible distance. That can be done by going as fast as possible until song ends.

You can speed up your car by correctly hitting arrows when they are in desired area. Controls are WASD, Arrow Keys or even gamepad joystick.

When you miss arrow or hit wrong key, you lost bonus to streak and risk slowing down your car!

You can choose predefined song or any other song in .ogg or .wav format. You add your song by putting it into:
/Nautilus Studios/Bass Racer/UserSongs
(inside of wherever your OS stores application data, Windows: appdata and Mac OS: application support)
